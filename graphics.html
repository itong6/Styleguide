    <h1>GRAPHICS & ICONS</h1>
    <p>These illustrations maintain the minimal, cartoon-like aesthetic of Meaty. This particular style is used to captivate the audience with cute and friendly avatars, contrasting and accentuating the essential message that the application is trying to convey. Unsuspecting users will believe the Meaty process is a cheerful and wholesome simulation, however soon after they have launched Meaty, the app will take a graphics yet realistic turn of events, making the message all the more impactful.

    <p id="centered-text">These are the main default sprites of the <span id="italic">Meaty</span> application.

        <p>The Meaty application also features patterns. These patterns appear at the end of the Meaty process, where users are greeted with facts and information revolving around food-origin awareness. Depending on which animal selected, one of the three distinct patterns will be in the background of the interface. </p>
